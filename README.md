# css_framework
*CSS framework, don't be shy and try to use it: you'll love it ! ðŸ˜‰*

---

## Configuration
1 - First, you can set your own configuration using the config file (Grid size etc...)
```
sass/utilities/_config.scss
```
## Start using the framework
1 - Build and create the css files
```
sass sass/main.scss styles.css
```

2 - Global utilisation
Globally, you can use the framework by using each different class in your .html file.
For example, you can use the class .mg-7 to add some margin to your container !
You can also use this framework to create elements:
alert
card
Some other elements will come next.

4 - You can edit our index.html file to test our custom classes.

5 - Then, to use the framework in a personal project you can import in your main css file.
```
@import "../css_framework/stylesheets/main.css";
```
